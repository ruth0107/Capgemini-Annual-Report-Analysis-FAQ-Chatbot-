ANNEXURE III
Remuneration Policy
The philosophy for remuneration of Directors, Key Managerial Personnel (“KMP”) and all other employees of the company (“Company”) is based on
the commitment of fostering a culture of leadership with trust."
423,The remuneration policy is aligned to this philosophy.
424,"This remuneration policy has been prepared pursuant to the provisions of Section 178(3) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”)."
425,"In case of any
inconsistency between the provisions of law and this remuneration policy, the provisions of the law shall prevail and the Company shall abide by
the applicable law."
426,"While formulating this policy, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (“NRC”) has considered the factors laid down under
Section 178(4) of the Act, which are as under:
(a) The level and composition of remuneration is reasonable and sufficient to attract, retain and motivate Directors of the quality required to run
the Company successfully;
(b) Relationship of remuneration to performance is clear and meets appropriate performance benchmarks; and
(c) Remuneration to Directors, Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management involves a balance between fixed and incentive pay reflecting
short and long-term performance objectives appropriate to the working of the Company and its goals."
427,"Key principles governing this remuneration policy are as follows:
• Remuneration for Independent Directors and Non-Independent Non-Executive Directors
- Independent Directors (“ID”) may be paid sitting fees (for attending the Meetings of the Board and of committees of which they may be
members)
- Quantum of sitting fees may be subject to review on a periodic basis, as required."
428,"In addition to the sitting fees, the Company may pay to any Director such fair and reasonable expenditure, as may have been incurred by
the Director while performing his/her role as a Director of the Company."
429,"This could include reasonable expenditure incurred by the Director
for attending Board/Board Committee meetings, General Meetings, Court Convened Meetings, Meetings with shareholders/creditors/
management, site visits, induction and training (organized by the company for directors) and in obtaining professional advice from independent
advisors in the furtherance of his/ her duties as a Director."
430,"• Remuneration for Whole – Time Director (“WTD”)/ Executive Directors (“ED”)/ KMP/ rest of the employees
The extent of overall remuneration should be sufficient to attract and retain talented and qualified individuals suitable for every role."
431,"Hence
remuneration should be
◊ Market competitive (market for every role is defined as companies from which the Company attracts talent or companies to which the
Company loses talent)
◊ Driven by the role played by the individual
◊ Reflective of size of the Company, complexity of the sector/ industry/ Company’s operations and the Company’s capacity to pay
◊ Consistent with recognized best practices and
◊ Aligned to any regulatory requirements
• In terms of remuneration mix or composition,
◊ The remuneration mix for the WTD/EDs is as per the contract approved by the shareholders."
432,"In case of any change, the same would require
the approval of the shareholders."
433,◊ Basic/fixed salary is provided to all employees to ensure that there is a steady income in line with their skills and experience.
434,"◊ In addition to the basic/fixed salary, the Company provides employees with certain perquisites, allowances and benefits to enable a certain
level of lifestyle and to offer scope for savings and tax optimization, where possible."
435,"The Company also offers social security coverage as
applicable."
436,"Other benefits offered are Medical Insurance coverage, life, accidental and disability coverage."
437,"We also run Wellness Program
for our employees under which doctors come and talk to them on topics such as lifestyle and health related issues, well-being etc."
438,◊ The Company provides retirement benefits as applicable.
439,"• In addition to the basic/ fixed salary, benefits, perquisites and allowances as provided above, the Company provides WTD/EDs such
remuneration by way of an annual incentive remuneration/performance linked bonus subject to the achievement of certain performance
criteria and such other parameters as may be considered appropriate from time to time by the Board."
440,"The Company provides the rest of the
employees a performance linked bonus."
441,"The performance linked bonus would be driven by the outcome of the performance appraisal process
and the performance of the Company."
442,"• Policy implementation
The NRC is responsible for recommending the remuneration policy to the Board."
443,"The Board is responsible for approving and overseeing
implementation of the remuneration policy."

subsidiary with an ‘appointed date’ of April 1, 2024, as approved by the National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai, vide Order dated May
6, 2025."
743,"As the amalgamation in the approved Scheme falls under ‘common control’ business combination, the Scheme has been given
effect to in the standalone financial statements of the Company from the beginning of preceding period, i.e., April 1, 2023, and accordingly
the comparative prior year financial information has been restated in accordance with Appendix C “Business Combinations under common
control” to Ind AS 103 “Business Combinations”."
744,Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
745,"Other Information

conclusion thereon."
749,"In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated."

this other information, we are required to report that fact."

756,"In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion."
760,"Reasonable assurance is a high level
of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists."

circumstances."

report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion."

conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report."

cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern."

5 Leases
Accounting policy
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for
consideration."
966,"Company as a lessee
The Company leases land, buildings, computer equipment and vehicles."
967,"The Company recognises a right-of-use asset which comprises
of amount of initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct cost incurred by the Company and estimated costs to dismantle or
remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received."
968,"The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life
of the underlying asset."
969,"Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not
be recoverable."
970,"Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss."
971,"The Company recognises lease liability at the present value of the future lease payments for non-cancellable period of a lease, except for
short term and lease of low value item."
972,Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components.
973,"The Company allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and
non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices."
974,"The future lease payments for non-cancellable period are discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate
that the company would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar
economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions."
975,"To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Company uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for
credit risk for leases held by the Company."
976,"Lease payments include fixed payments, amounts expected to be payable by the Company under residual value guarantee, the exercise
price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payment of penalties for terminating the lease if
the lease term considered reflects that the Company shall exercise termination option."
977,"Lease payments are allocated between principal and
finance cost."
978,"The finance cost is charged to Statement of Profit or Loss over lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate on the
remaining balance of the liability for each period."
979,The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
980,"It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease
payment, if there is a change in the Company’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the
Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option."
981,"When the lease lability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is
recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss if the carrying value of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero."
982,The Company presents right-of-use assets under ‘Right-of-use assets’ and lease liabilities in ‘Financial liabilities’ in the Balance sheet.
983,"Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and all leases of low-value assets are recognised as an expense in statement of
Profit or Loss."
984,Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.
985,"Critical judgements and estimates
The Company uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate."
986,"In assessing whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a
lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Company to exercise the option to extend
the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease."
987,"Most extension option in office leases have not been included in the lease
liability because the Company can replace the assets without incurring significant cost or business disruptions."
988,"The Company revises the
lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease."
989,"The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with
similar characteristics."

6 Goodwill and other Intangible assets
Accounting policy
Goodwill
Goodwill arising from a business combination is included in intangible assets."
997,"Goodwill is not amortised, but it is tested for impairment
annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated
impairment losses."
998,"Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized at cost."
999,"Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any."
1000,"Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful economic life and are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired."
1001,An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
1002,"Gains or losses
arising from disposal of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the
asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss."
1003,"Internally developed intangible assets
Computer software includes internally developed intangible assets comprising of automated software application (bots) which are intended
for reuse across several customers."
1004,"On initial recognition, an internally generated intangible asset is measured at cost if it is probable that
future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably."
1005,"The cost of
an internally generated intangible asset is the sum of expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition
criteria to the completion of its development."
1006,"Amortisation method and useful life estimates
Gross block Useful life
Computer software 3-5 years
Customer relationships 5-8 years
Non-compete 3-5 years
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Company’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any
indication of impairment."
1007,"If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated."
1008,"Goodwill is tested annually for
impairment."
1009,"For impairment testing, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are combined together into cash-generating units
(CGUs)."
1010,"Each CGU represents the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows
of other assets or CGUs."
1011,"The identification of CGU involves judgment, including assessment of where active market exists and the level of
interdependency of the cashflows."
1012,"65
A NNUAL REPORT 2024-25
Notes forming part of standalone financial statements (Contd.)"
1013,"(Currency : INR in million)
The recoverable amount of a CGU (or an individual asset) is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell."
1014,"Value in use
is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU (or the asset)."

Impairment test for goodwill
Goodwill is monitored by management at the level of cash generating unit (CGUs)."
1018,"Below are the key assumptions used for impairment
testing of goodwill."
1019,"Key assumptions:
Revenue growth rate 4% to 7%
Long-term growth rate 4.2%
Pre-tax discount rate 13.3%
66
A NNUAL REPORT 2024-25
Notes forming part of standalone financial statements (Contd.)"
1020,"(Currency : INR in million)
Approach used to determine values of assumptions:
Revenue growth rate over the five-year forecast period is based on past performance and management’s expectations of market development."
1021,"Annual capital expenditure is based on the historical experience of management, and the planned refurbishment expenditure."
1022,"No incremental
revenue or cost savings are assumed in the value-in-use model as a result of this expenditure."
1023,Long-term growth rate is the weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period.
1024,"The rates are consistent
with forecasts included in industry reports."
1025,Pre-tax discount rates reflect specific risks relating to the relevant industry and economic conditions in which the Company operate.
1026,"As a result of the management annual goodwill impairment test for the year ended 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2024, no goodwill impairment
was identified."
1027,"7 Financial assets
Accounting Policy
(i) Recognition and initial measurement
All financial assets other than trade receivables are initially recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of
the instrument."
1028,"A financial asset is initially measured at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss
(FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset."
1029,"Trade receivables are initially measured at
transaction price as they do not contain any significant financing components or pricing adjustments embedded in the contract."
1030,"The Company
holds the trade receivables with the objective of collecting the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised
cost less loss allowance."
1031,"(ii) Classification and subsequent measurement
Financial asset is classified as ‘equity instrument’ if it is a non-derivative and meets the definition of ‘equity’ for the issuer."
1032,"All other non-
derivative financial assets are ‘debt instruments’."
1033,"On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as below:
(a) Financial asset measured at amortised cost:
A debt instrument is subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method less any impairment, if the asset is held
within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give
rise on specified dates to cash flows, that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding."
1034,"Interest income
is recognised on an effective yield basis in other income."
1035,"Financial assets measured at amortised cost includes non-current investments other
than investment in subsidiaries, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, bank balances other than cash and cash equivalents and other
current and non-current financial assets."
1036,"(b) Financial asset carried at fair value through other comprehensive income:
Financial asset subsequently measured at FVOCI comprise of:
i."
1037,"Equity securities (listed and unlisted) which are not held for trading, and for which the Company has irrevocably elected at initial recognition
to recognise changes in fair value through OCI rather than profit or loss."
1038,"These are strategic investments, and the Company considers this
classification to be more relevant."
1039,There are currently no equity instruments which are carried at FVOCI.
1040,ii.
1041,"Debt securities where the contractual cash flows are solely principal and interest and the objective of the Company’s business model is
achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets."
1042,"There are currently no debt securities which are carried at
FVOCI."
1043,"(c) Financial asset carried at fair value through profit or loss:
A financial asset, which does not qualify for measurement at either amortised cost or FVOCI, is subsequently measured at fair value and any
gain / loss is recognised in profit or loss."
1044,It includes current investments.
1045,"(d) Investment in subsidiary
The Company has accounted investment in subsidiary at cost."
1046,"67
A NNUAL REPORT 2024-25
Notes forming part of standalone financial statements (Contd.)"
1047,"(Currency : INR in million)
(iii) Derecognition
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the
rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset
are transferred or in which the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain
control of the financial asset."
1048,"(iv) Impairment of financial instruments
The Company recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost
The Company assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset is credit impaired."
1049,"A financial asset is ‘credit impaired’ when
one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred."
1050,"Ind AS 109 requires
expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance."
1051,Loss allowances for trade receivables (including unbilled revenue) are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.
1052,"In determining expected credit losses for trade receivables, the Company has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit
loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix."
1053,"The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and
is adjusted for forward looking information."
1054,"The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and
allowance rates used in the provision matrix."
1055,"For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount
equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition."
1056,"When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating expected
credit losses, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort."
1057,"This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Company’s historical experience and informed credit
assessment and including forward looking information."
1058,"The amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date is recognized as an
impairment loss or gain in Statement of Profit and Loss."
1059,"Individual financial assets are written off when management deems them not to be
collectible
(v) Offsetting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Company
currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle
the liability simultaneously."
1060,"(vi) Derivatives
The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange
rates on foreign currency exposure."
1061,The counter party for these contracts is generally a bank.
1062,"The use of foreign currency forward contracts is governed by the Company’s policies, which provide written principles on the use of such
financial derivatives consistent with the Company’s risk management strategy."
1063,"The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes."
1064,"Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their
fair value at the end of each reporting period."
1065,"The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is
designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged."
1066,"The Company designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised assets and liabilities
and highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges)."
1067,"At inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items
including whether the changes in the cash flows of the hedging instrument are expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items."
1068,The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.
1069,"68
A NNUAL REPORT 2024-25
Notes forming part of standalone financial statements (Contd.)"
1070,"(Currency : INR in million)
Cash flow hedges
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is
recognised in OCI and accumulated in the Other equity under ‘Cash flow hedging reserve’."
1071,"The effective portion of changes in the fair value of
the derivative that is recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis,
from inception of the hedge."
1072,"Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in the Statement of
Profit and Loss."
1073,"Embedded foreign currency derivatives
Embedded foreign currency derivatives are not separated from the host contract if they are closely related."
1074,"Such embedded derivatives are
closely related to the host contract, if the host contract is not leveraged, does not contain any option feature and requires payments in one of
the following currencies:
• the functional currency of any substantial party to that contract,
• the currency in which the price of the related good or service that is acquired or delivered is routinely denominated in commercial
transactions around the world,
• a currency that is commonly used in contracts to purchase or sell non-financial items in the economic environment in which the transaction
takes place (i.e., relatively liquid and stable currency)
Foreign currency embedded derivatives which do not meet the above criteria are separated and the derivative is accounted for at fair value
through profit or loss."
1075,The Company currently does not have any such derivatives which are not closely related.

14 Revenue from operations
Accounting policy
Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised services to customers at the contracted price which the Company receives in
exchange for those services."
1205,"The method for recognizing revenue depends on the nature of the services rendered:
(a) Revenue from related parties
Revenue from services rendered to parent company, ultimate parent company, subsidiaries and fellow subsidiaries is recognized on cost plus
mark-up basis determined on arm’s length principle as and when the related services are rendered."
1206,"(b) Revenue from external customers
(i) Time and material contracts
Revenue from time and material contracts is recognized over the time as the related services are rendered."
1207,"Revenue from these contracts
is measured based on the number of hours spent on the contract and contracted rate."
1208,"(ii) Fixed price contracts
Revenue from fixed-price development contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method, under which the contract
performance is determined by relating the actual costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs for each contract."
1209,"The cost incurred
(or input) method is used to measure progress as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity."
1210,"If the Company does not
have a sufficient basis to measure the progress of completion, revenue is recognized only to the extent contract costs incurred, for which
recoverability is probable."
1211,The related costs on deliverable- based contracts are expensed as incurred.
1212,"Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change."
1213,"Any resulting increases or
decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the
revision become known by management."
1214,"Revenue from fixed-price maintenance contracts is recognised based on a fixed price per work unit consumed, or based on monthly
fixed fees subject to adjustment mechanisms for volume changes or scope changes."
1215,"Recurring services are considered to be one single
performance obligation, comprised of a series of distinct daily units of service satisfied over time."

1217,"(Currency : INR in million)
(iii) Others
The Company does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised services or goods to the
customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year."
1218,"As a consequence, the Company does not adjust any of the transaction prices
for the time value of money."
1219,"Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, if
any, as specified in the contract with the customer."
1220,Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.
1221,"Contract Assets and Liabilities
Contract assets are presented separately from financial assets."
1222,"Contract assets reflect revenue recognized for which the corresponding
rights to receive consideration are contingent upon something else other than the passage of time, such as the Company’s future
performance, achievement of billing milestones, or customer acceptance."
1223,"Accordingly, contract assets (unbilled revenue) is disclosed
under other current assets."
1224,"When customer contract assets are no longer contingent, except for the passage of time, they convert into
financial assets and are disclosed as trade receivables - unbilled."
1225,Contract liabilities represent consideration received or receivable in advance of performance or billing in excess of revenue.
1226,"Contract
assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis for each individual contract."
1227,"The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance-based payments and / or milestone-based progress
payments."
1228,Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.
1229,"(iv) Judgements in revenue recognition
- Judgement is required to determine the transaction price for the contract."
1230,"The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of
customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses,
price concessions and incentives."
1231,- Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using percentage-of-completion method.

Use of estimates
The cost of the defined benefit plans, compensated absences and the present value of the defined benefit obligation are based on actuarial
valuation using the projected unit credit method."

developments in the future."

21 Income tax
Accounting policy
Current and deferred tax
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax."
1358,"It is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent that it relates to a
business combination or to an item recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income."
1359,"Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable
or receivable in respect of previous years."
1360,"The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or
received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes."
1361,"It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date in each of the applicable jurisdictions."
1362,"Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to
interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment."
1363,"The Company measures its
tax balances either based on the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method provides a better prediction of the
resolution of the uncertainty."
1364,"Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it is
intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously."
1365,"Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes."
1366,"Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of carried forward tax losses
and tax credits."
1367,"Deferred tax is not recognised for:
- temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction;
- temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of
the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill."
1368,"The recognition of deferred tax assets is based on availability of sufficient taxable profits in the Company against which such assets can be
utilized."
1369,"The Company reviews the deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date and reduces to the extent that it is no longer probable that
the related tax benefit will be realized."
1370,"Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on
the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date."
1371,"The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the
reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities."
1372,"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to
income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities
and assets on a net basis, or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously."
1373,"Transfer pricing
The Company has established a comprehensive system of maintenance of information and documents as required by the transfer pricing
legislation under sections 92-92F of the Income-tax Act, 1961."
1374,"Since the law requires existence of such information and documentation to
be contemporaneous in nature, the Company is in the process of updating the documentation for the international transactions entered into
with the associated enterprises during the financial year."
1375,"The Company is required to update and put in place the information a month prior to
the due date of filing its income tax return."
1376,"The management is of the opinion that its international transactions are at arm’s length so that the
aforesaid legislation will not have any impact on the financial statements, particularly on the amount of tax expenses and that of provision for
tax."
1377,"Use of estimates
The Company provides for tax considering the applicable tax regulations and based on reasonable estimates."
1378,"Management periodically
evaluates positions taken in the tax returns giving due considerations to tax laws and establishes provisions if required as a result of differing
interpretation or due to retrospective amendments, if any."
1379,"Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes,
including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions."

25 Earnings per equity share (EPS)
Accounting policy
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number
of equity shares outstanding during the year."
1465,"Partly paid equity shares are treated as a fraction of an equity share to the extent that they are
entitled to participate in dividends relative to a fully paid equity share during the reporting year."
1466,"The weighted average number of equity shares
outstanding during the year is adjusted for events such as bonus issue, amalgamations, bonus element in a rights issue, buyback, share split,
and reverse share split (consolidation of shares) that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change
in resources."
1467,"The number of equity shares used in computing diluted earnings per share comprises the weighted average number of equity shares
considered to derive the basic EPS, and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued on conversion of all
the dilutive potential equity shares which are deemed converted at the beginning of reporting period, unless issued at a later date."
1468,"There have been no other transactions involving Equity shares or potential Equity shares between the reporting date and the date of
authorisation of these financial statements."
1469,"The following table reflects the profit and share data used to compute basic and diluted EPS:

1473,"Accounting classification and fair values
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amounts at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation state."
1474,"The Company classifies its inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities."
1475,"The mutual funds are valued using the closing NAV
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e."

1484,"Fair value of
forward contracts derivative financial instruments are based on prices as provided by the banks and are classified as Level 2."
1485,"Inputs
include current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing."
1486,Investments The Company’s investments consist primarily of investment in debt linked mutual funds.
1487,"Fair value of debt linked
mutual funds are based on prices as stated by the issuers of mutual funds and are classified as Level 1 after
considering whether the fair value is readily determinable."
1488,"During the reporting years ended 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2024, there have been no transfers of financial instruments between Level 1 or
Level 2 or Level 3 fair value measurements."
1489,"Fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost
The carrying amounts of current financial assets / liabilities recognised in the financial statements at amortised value, approximate their fair
values due to their short-term nature."
1490,"For financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, the carrying amounts are equal to the
fair values."
1491,The fair value of long-term security deposit is Rs.
1492,"1,592 as at 31 March 2025 and is Rs.1,211 as at 31 March 2024."

1498,The fair value of non-current financial Liabilities approximates its carrying value.
1499,"C. Financial risk management
The Company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
• Credit risk ;
• Liquidity risk ; and
• Market risk
i."
1500,"Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
obligations and arises principally from the Company’s receivables from customers and investments in debt securities."
1501,"The carrying amount of following financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure:
Trade and other receivables
The Company periodically assesses the financial reliability of its customers, taking into account the financial conditions, current economic
trends and analysis of historic bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable."
1502,"Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable
expectation of recovery from the customer."
1503,The Company has trade receivables primarily from intercompanies.
1504,"On analysis of historic bad debts and ageing of accounts of these
receivables, the probability of default is assessed to be Nil and the Company does not foresee any credit risk."
1505,"To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics
and the days past due."
1506,"The contract assets relate to unbilled work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade
receivables for the same types of contracts."
1507,"The Company has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a
reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets."
1508,"The Company’s exposure to customers is diversified and there is no single customer (other than related parties) contributing more than 10%
of total outstanding trade receivable and unbilled revenue."
1509,"The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of customers over a period of 36 months before the reporting date and the
corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period."
1510,"The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-
looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables."

Credit risk of the Company on cash and cash equivalents and investments is subject to low credit risk since the investments of the Company
are only in debt mutual funds, fixed maturity plan securities with banks and financial institutions with a high credit rating by domestic and
international credit rating agencies."
1516,"Counter parties to foreign currency forward contracts are generally multinational banks with appropriate
market standing."
1517,ii.
1518,"Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled
by delivering cash or another financial asset."
1519,"The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses
or risking damage to the Company’s reputation."
1520,"The Company also has sufficient overdraft credit facilities with financial institutions to meet any
liquidity requirements."

when they fall due."

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Company’s income or
the value of its holdings of financial instruments."

currency receivables and payables."
1527,"The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk and market value
of its investments."
1528,"The exposure to market risk is a function of investing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign
currency."

27 Contingent liabilities and commitments
Accounting policy
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present obligation that is not recognized because
it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation."
1545,"A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases
where there is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably."

liability but discloses its existence in the financial statements."

in the Director’s report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon."
1622,"Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon."
1623,"In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated."

1634,"Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion."
1635,"Reasonable assurance is a high level
of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists."
1636,"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements."
1637,9.
1638,"As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit."
1639,"We
also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion."
1640,"The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control."
1641,"• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances."
1642,"Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company
has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of
such controls."
1643,"• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made
by management."
1644,"• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group
to continue as a going concern."
1645,"If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report
to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion."
1646,"Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report."
1647,"However, future events or conditions may
cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern."
1648,"• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether
the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation."
1649,"• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group
to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements."
1650,"We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting period."
1756,"Examples
of such estimates include estimates of contract costs to be incurred to complete software development project, provision for taxes, employee
benefit plans, provision for doubtful debts and advances and estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment."
1757,"Although these estimates
are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from these estimates."
1758,"Estimates and
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis."
1759,"Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in current and
future periods."
1760,"3 Property, plant and equipment

1764,"Subsequent expenditure related to an item of property, plant and equipment is added to its book value only if it increases the future benefits
from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed standard of performance."
1765,"All other expenses on existing property, plant and equipment,
including day-to-day repairs and maintenance expenditure and cost of replacing parts, are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss for the
period during which such expenses are incurred."

the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is disposed."
1767,"Assets that will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale and are shown under
‘Other current assets’."

Buildings* 25-42 years
Leasehold Improvements Lower of lease period or 6 years
Computers* 3-5 years
Furniture and fixtures* 3- 7 years

5 Leases
Accounting Policy
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for
consideration."
1778,"Company as a lessee
The Group leases land, buildings, computer equipment and vehicles."
1779,"The Group recognises a right-of-use asset which comprises of amount of
initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct cost incurred by the Group and estimated costs to dismantle or remove the underlying
asset or to restore the underlying asset or site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received."
1780,"The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life
of the underlying asset."
1781,"Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be
recoverable."
1782,"Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss."
1783,"The Group recognises lease liability at the present value of the future lease payments for non-cancellable period of a lease, except for short
term and lease of low value item."
1784,Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components.
1785,"The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease
components based on their relative stand-alone prices."
1786,"The future lease payments for non-cancellable period is discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate that the
Group would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic
environment with similar terms, security and conditions."
1787,"To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk
for leases held by the Group."
1788,"Lease payments include fixed payments, amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantee, the exercise price of
a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payment of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term
considered reflects that the Group shall exercise termination option."
1789,Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost.
1790,"The
finance cost is charged to Statement of Profit and Loss over lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate on the remaining balance
of the liability for each period."
1791,The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
1792,"It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease
payment, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group
changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option."
1793,"When the lease lability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is
recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss if the carrying value of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero."
1794,The Group presents right-of-use assets under ‘Right-of-use assets’ and lease liabilities in ‘Financial liabilities’ in the Balance sheet.
1795,"Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and all leases of low-value assets are recognised as an expense in Statement of
Profit or Loss."
1796,Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.
1797,"Critical judgements and estimates
The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate."
1798,"In assessing whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease,
it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group to exercise the option to extend the lease, or
not to exercise the option to terminate the lease."
1799,"Most extension option in office leases have not been included in the lease liability because the
Group can replace the assets without incurring significant cost or business disruptions."
1800,"The Group revises the lease term if there is a change
in the non-cancellable period of a lease."
1801,"The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with
similar characteristics."

6 Other Intangible assets
Accounting policy
Goodwill
Goodwill arising from a business combination is included in intangible assets."
1807,"Goodwill is not amortised but it is tested for impairment
annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated
impairment losses."
1808,"Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized at cost."
1809,"Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any."
1810,"Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful economic life and are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be
impaired."
1811,An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
1812,"Gains or losses
arising from disposal of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of
the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss."
1813,"Internally developed intangible assets
Computer software includes internally developed intangible assets comprising of automated software application (bots) which are intended
for reuse across several customers."
1814,"On initial recognition, an internally generated intangible asset is measured at cost if it is probable that
future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably."
1815,"The cost of
an internally generated intangible asset is the sum of expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition
criteria to the completion of its development."
1816,"Amortisation method and useful life estimates
Gross block Useful life
Computer software 3 - 5 years
Customer relationships 5 - 8 years
Non-compete 3 - 5 years
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any
indication of impairment."
1817,"If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated."
1818,"Goodwill is tested annually for
impairment."
1819,"For impairment testing, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are combined together into cash-generating units
(CGUs)."
1820,"Each CGU represents the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows
138
A NNUAL REPORT 2024-25

1821,"(Currency : INR in million)
of other assets or CGUs."
1822,"The identification of CGU involves judgment, including assessment of where active market exists and the level of
interdependency of the cashflows."
1823,The recoverable amount of a CGU (or an individual asset) is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
1824,"Value in use
is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU (or the asset)."
1825,An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.

Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill is monitored by management at the level of cash generating unit (CGUs)."
1828,"Considering the expected benefits from synergies arising
from the business combination, the Group is considered as one CGU."
1829,Below are the key assumptions used for impairment testing of goodwill.
1830,"Key assumptions :
Revenue growth rate 4% to 7%
Long-term growth rate 4.2%
Pre-tax discount rate 13.3%
Approach used to determine values of assumptions
Revenue growth rate over the five-year forecast period is based on past performance and management’s expectations of market development."
1831,"Annual capital expenditure is based on the historical experience of management, and the planned refurbishment expenditure."
1832,"No incremental
revenue or cost savings are assumed in the value-in-use model as a result of this expenditure."
1833,Long-term growth rate is the weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period.
1834,"The rates are consistent
with forecasts included in industry reports."
1835,Pre-tax discount rates reflects specific risks relating to the relevant industry and economic conditions in which the Group operate.
1836,"As a result of the management annual goodwill impairment test for the year ended 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2024, no goodwill impairment
was identified."

All financial assets other than trade receivables are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument."
1839,"A financial asset is initially measured at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss
(FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset."
1840,"Trade receivables are initially measured at
transaction price as they do not contain any significant financing components or pricing adjustments embedded in the contract."
1841,"The Group
holds the trade receivables with the objective of collecting the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised
cost, less loss allowance."
1842,"(ii) Classification and subsequent measurement
Financial asset is classified as ‘equity instrument’ if it is a non-derivative and meets the definition of ‘equity’ for the issuer."
1843,"All other non-
derivative financial assets are ‘debt instruments’."
1844,"On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as below:
(a) Financial asset measured at amortised cost:
A debt instrument is subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method less any impairment, if the asset is held
within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give
rise on specified dates to cash flows, that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding."
1845,"Interest income
is recognised on an effective yield basis in other income."
1846,"Financial assets measured at amortised cost includes non-current investments other
than investment in subsidiaries, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, bank balances other than cash and cash equivalents and other
current and non-current financial assets."
1847,"(b) Financial asset carried at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI):
Financial asset subsequently measured at FVOCI comprise of:
i."
1848,"Equity securities (listed and unlisted) which are not held for trading, and for which the Group has irrevocably elected at initial recognition
to recognise changes in fair value through OCI rather than profit or loss."
1849,"These are strategic investments, and the Group considers this
classification to be more relevant."
1850,There are currently no equity instruments which are carried at FVOCI.
1851,ii.
1852,"Debt securities where the contractual cash flows are solely principal and interest and the objective of the Group’s business model is
achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets."
1853,"There are currently no debt securities which are carried
at FVOCI."
1854,"(c) Financial asset carried at fair value through profit or loss:
A financial asset, which does not qualify for measurement at either amortised cost or FVOCI, is subsequently measured at fair value and any
gain / loss is recognised in profit or loss."
1855,It includes current investments.
1856,"(iii) Derecognition
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights
to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are
transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control
of the financial asset."
1857,"(iv) Impairment of financial instruments
The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost."
1858,The Group assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset is credit impaired.
1859,"A financial asset is ‘credit impaired’ when one
or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred."
1860,"Ind AS 109 requires
expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance."
1861,Loss allowances for trade receivables (including unbilled revenue) are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.
1862,"In determining expected credit losses for trade receivables, the Group has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss
allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix."
1863,"The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and
is adjusted for forward looking information."
1864,"The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and
allowance rates used in the provision matrix."
1865,"140
A NNUAL REPORT 2024-25
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements (Contd.)"
1866,"(Currency : INR in million)
For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount
equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition."
1867,"When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating expected
credit losses, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort."
1868,"This
includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment
and including forward looking information."
1869,"The amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date is recognized as an
impairment loss or gain in Statement of Profit and Loss."
1870,"Individual financial assets are written off when management deems them not to be
collectible."
1871,"(v) Offsetting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Group currently
has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the
liability simultaneously."
1872,"(vi) Derivatives
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates
on foreign currency exposure."
1873,The counter party for these contracts is generally a bank.
1874,"The use of foreign currency forward contracts are governed by the Group’s policies, which provide written principles on the use of such financial
derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy."
1875,"The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes."
1876,"Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their
fair value at the end of each reporting period."
1877,"The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is
designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged."
1878,"The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised assets and liabilities and
highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges)."
1879,"At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items
including whether the changes in the cash flows of the hedging instrument are expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items."
1880,"The
Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions."
1881,"Cash flow hedges
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is
recognised in OCI and accumulated in the Other equity under ‘Cash flow hedging reserve’."
1882,"The effective portion of changes in the fair value of
the derivative that is recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis,
from inception of the hedge."
1883,"Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in the Statement of
Profit and Loss."
1884,"Embedded foreign currency derivatives
Embedded foreign currency derivatives are not separated from the host contract if they are closely related."
1885,"Such embedded derivatives are
closely related to the host contract, if the host contract is not leveraged, does not contain any option feature and requires payments in one of
the following currencies:
• the functional currency of any substantial party to that contract,
• the currency in which the price of the related good or service that is acquired or delivered is routinely denominated in commercial
transactions around the world,
• a currency that is commonly used in contracts to purchase or sell non-financial items in the economic environment in which the transaction
takes place (i.e."
1886,"relatively liquid and stable currency)
Foreign currency embedded derivatives which do not meet the above criteria are separated and the derivative is accounted for at fair value
through profit or loss."
1887,The Group currently does not have any such derivatives which are not closely related.

16 Employee benefits expense
Accounting policy
(i) Short-term employee benefits
Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of receiving employee services are classified as short-term employee benefits."
2066,"These
benefits include salaries and wages, bonus and ex-gratia."
2067,"The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits to be paid in exchange
for employee services is recognised as an expense as the related service is rendered by employees."
2068,"(ii) Post employment benefits
(a) Defined benefit plan - Gratuity
The Group’s gratuity benefit scheme is a defined benefit plan."
2069,"The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of this plan
is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets."
2070,"The discount rates used for determining the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plan is based on the market yields
as at the balance sheet date on Government securities, having maturity periods approximating to the terms of the related obligations."
2071,"The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net opening balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair
value of plan assets less estimated employer contribution for the next financial year."
2072,"This cost is included in employee benefit expenses
in the Statement of Profit and Loss."
2073,"Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial
assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income."
2074,"All other expenses related to
defined benefit plan is recognised in employee benefit expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss."

unvested is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the entity
recognises related restructuring cost or termination benefits."
2076,"The Group recognises gains and losses on the curtailment or settlement of
a defined benefit plan when the curtailment or settlement occurs."
2077,"The present value of the obligation under such benefit plan is determined based on an actuarial valuation using the Projected Unit Credit
Method."
2078,"(b) Defined benefit plan - Pension
The Group provides for superannuation scheme which is applicable to certain eligible employees."
2079,"The plan provides lump sum payment
based on a vesting period."
2080,The Group’s liability is actuarially determined using Projected Unit Cost method at the end of each year.

2082,"(c) Defined contribution plan - Provident fund
Provident fund monthly contributions are remitted to the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, a Government authority for the entire
year."
2083,"The Group has no further obligation to contribute other than the monthly contributions and, therefore, the plan is accounted as
defined contribution plan."
2084,"(iii) Other long-term employee benefit obligations
Compensated absences:
The employees can carry-forward a portion of the unutilised accrued compensated absences and utilise it in future service periods or receive
cash compensation on termination of employment."
2085,"The obligation in respect of compensated absences is provided on the basis of an actuarial
valuation carried out by an independent actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method, which recognizes each period of service as giving
rise to an additional unit of employee benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation."
2086,"The obligation
is measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows."
2087,"The discount rates used for determining the present value of the obligation
under defined benefit plan is based on the market yields as at the balance sheet date on Government securities, having maturity periods
approximating to the terms of the related obligations."
2088,"To the extent the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer the utilization or
encashment of the accumulated compensated absences, the liability determined based on actuarial valuation is considered to be a current
liability."
2089,"Use of estimates
The cost of the defined benefit plans, compensated absences and the present value of the defined benefit obligation are based on actuarial
valuation using the projected unit credit method."
2090,"An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual
developments in the future."
2091,"These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates."
2092,"Due to the
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions."
2093,All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

21 Income tax
Accounting policy
Current and deferred tax
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax."
2146,"It is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent that it relates to a
business combination or to an item recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income."
2147,"Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable
or receivable in respect of previous years."
2148,"The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or
received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes."
2149,"It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date in each of the applicable jurisdictions."
2150,"Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to
interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment."
2151,"The Group measures its
tax balances either based on the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method provides a better prediction of the
resolution of the uncertainty."
2152,"Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it is
intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously."
2153,"Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes."
2154,"Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of carried forward tax losses
and tax credits."
2155,"Deferred tax is not recognised for:
- temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction;
- temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the
temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill."
2156,The recognition of deferred tax assets is based on availability of sufficient taxable profits in the Group against which such assets can be utilized.
2157,"The Group reviews the deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date and reduces to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related
tax benefit will be realized."
2158,"Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on
the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date."
2159,"The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting
date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities."
2160,"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate
to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax
liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously."
2161,"Transfer pricing
The Group has established a comprehensive system of maintenance of information and documents as required by the transfer pricing
legislation under sections 92-92F of the Income-tax Act, 1961."
2162,"Since the law requires existence of such information and documentation to be
contemporaneous in nature, the Group is in the process of updating the documentation for the international transactions entered into with the
associated enterprises during the financial year."
2163,"The Group is required to update and put in place the information a month prior to the due
date of filing its income tax return."
2164,"The management is of the opinion that its international transactions are at arm’s length so that the aforesaid
legislation will not have any impact on the financial statements, particularly on the amount of tax expenses and that of provision for tax."
2165,"Use of estimates
The Group provides for tax considering the applicable tax regulations and based on reasonable estimates."
2166,"Management periodically evaluates
positions taken in the tax returns giving due considerations to tax laws and establishes provisions if required as a result of differing interpretation
or due to retrospective amendments, if any."

expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions."

Accounting policy
Common control business combinations
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the control of the shareholder that controls the Group
are accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or, if later, at the date that
common control was established; for this purpose comparatives are revised."

amounts."

which they appeared in the financial statements of the acquired entity."

share capital of the acquired entity is transferred to capital reserve."
2194,"In the absence of the capital reserve, consideration in excess of carrying
value of the net assets (including the reserves) taken over is adjusted to the Retained earnings."
2195,"In accounting for business combinations, judgement is required in identifying whether an identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded
separately from goodwill."
2196,"Additionally, estimating the acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired (including useful life
estimates), liabilities acquired and contingent consideration assumed involves management judgement."
2197,"These measurements are based
on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by
management."

25 Earnings per equity share (EPS)
Accounting policy
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number
of equity shares outstanding during the year."
2266,"Partly paid equity shares are treated as a fraction of an equity share to the extent that they are
entitled to participate in dividends relative to a fully paid equity share during the reporting year."
2267,"The weighted average number of equity shares
outstanding during the year is adjusted for events such as bonus issue, amalgamations, bonus element in a rights issue, Buyback, share split,
and reverse share split (consolidation of shares) that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change
in resources."
2268,"The number of equity shares used in computing diluted earnings per share comprises the weighted average number of equity shares
considered to derive the basic EPS, and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued on conversion of all
the dilutive potential equity shares which are deemed converted at the beginning of reporting period, unless issued at a later date."
2269,"There have been no other transactions involving Equity shares or potential Equity shares between the reporting date and the date of
authorisation of these financial statements."

Foreign exchange The Group’s derivative financial instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts."
2283,"Fair value of derivative
forward contracts financial instruments are based on prices as provided by the banks and are classified as Level 2."
2284,"Inputs include
current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing."
2285,Investments The Group’s investments consist primarily of investment in debt linked mutual funds.
2286,"Fair value of debt linked
mutual funds are based on prices as stated by the issuers of mutual funds and are classified as Level 1 after
considering whether the fair value is readily determinable."
2287,"During the reporting years ended 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2024, there have been no transfers of financial instruments between Level 1 or
Level 2 or Level 3 fair value measurements."
2288,"Fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost
The carrying amounts of current financial assets / liabilities recognised in the financial statements at amortised value, approximate their fair
values due to their short-term nature."
2289,"For financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, the carrying amounts are equal to the
fair values."

2298,"C. Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
• Credit risk ;
• Liquidity risk ; and
• Market risk
i."
2299,"Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations,
and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investments in debt securities."
2300,"The carrying amount of following financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure:
Trade and other receivables
The Group periodically assesses the financial reliability of its customers, taking into account the financial conditions, current economic trends
and analysis of historic bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable."
2301,"Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation
of recovery from the customer."
2302,The Group has trade receivables primarily from intercompanies.
2303,"On analysis of historic bad debts and ageing of accounts of these receivables,
the Group does not foresee any credit risk."
2304,"To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics
and the days past due."
2305,"The contract assets relate to unbilled work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the
trade receivables for the same types of contracts."
2306,"The Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a
reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets."
2307,"The Group’s exposure to customers is diversified and there is no single customer (other than related parties) contributing more than 10% of
total outstanding trade receivable and unbilled revenue."
2308,"The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 months before the reporting date and the corresponding
historical credit losses experienced within this period."
2309,"The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information
on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables."

market standing."

2317,"Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled
by delivering cash or another financial asset."
2318,"The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risking damage to the Group’s reputation."

requirements."

foreign currency receivables and payables and long term debt."

risk and market value of its investments."
